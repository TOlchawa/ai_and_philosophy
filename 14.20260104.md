Will AI Be Used to Govern States in 2026?

We are not yet at the point where artificial intelligence operates as a fully autonomous “ruler” of the state apparatus. There is no credible evidence that in 2026 any country will deploy AI as a sovereign decision-making system governing the state without human oversight.

Current directions and examples:

Albania (2025) marks the first case of an AI system formally acting as a “minister” (Diella), responsible for public procurement. This is a symbolic and tightly constrained deployment, with human supervision at every critical step. Still, it signals a broader trend: the integration of AI into the upper layers of public administration.

China places strong emphasis on AI infrastructure and its integration into administrative systems, not as an independent “AI government,” but as a tool for decision support and large-scale social governance. AI there is embedded into state capacity rather than elevated to political autonomy.

Types of AI shaped by origin and political context:

Approaches to AI governance differ according to political culture. China tends toward centralized control and system-level stability, while the United States emphasizes market-driven innovation and competitive advantage. These differences are not accidental; they reflect distinct normative assumptions about the role of the state, the individual, and technology.

All of this should be read in the context of the framework proposed in “Three Kinds of AI Ethics” (arXiv:2503.18842), which distinguishes between ethics and AI, ethics in AI, and ethics of AI. What we are observing today is not the rise of a universal, machine-defined morality, but the encoding of existing political and ethical priorities into technical systems.

In short, AI is increasingly shaping how states function, but claims of fully autonomous AI governance remain premature. For now, human oversight is still very much part of the picture, and despite the hype, we are not ready to hand over the keys just yet.
