What about Pegasus?

I read this article and started wondering whether the time will come when videos and audio recordings will no longer be accepted as evidence in court.
How will this affect the perception of truth, especially in legal proceedings?
How will it change the way investigations are conducted?
What impact will it have on the entire blackmail market built on recordings, photos, and similar materials?
Will it bring any meaningful change at all?

For now, it is still difficult to fool professional forensic analyses. Time will tell..
