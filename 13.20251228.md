** AI for free: early 2025 vs late 2025 **

Early 2025:

- a chatbot mainly for writing text and answering questions

- interaction limited to typing

- short memory, after a few messages a full “personality reset”

- images, files, voice: mostly curiosities or trial features

- useful, practical stuff usually locked behind a paywall


Late 2025:

- natural voice conversations with AI, like an automated assistant that finally works

- drop in a PDF, photo, or table and get a sensible answer

- image and text generation without jumping through hoops

- context memory measured in dozens of pages, not three paragraphs

- AI built into messengers, search, and the system itself, no installation needed

- things that were “premium” a year ago are now standard


Subjective takeaway:
At the start of 2025, free AI was a toy for testing.
By the end of 2025, free AI became a real, everyday tool.

Not “the AI of the future.”
Just something that already exists and works.
And you don’t even have to pull out your credit card.
