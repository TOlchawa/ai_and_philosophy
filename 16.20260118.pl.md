** AI Is Efficient. Humans Are Not. Now What? **

Generating a moderately complex application with AI can consume as much as 10 kWh of electricity – that’s the result of a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation:
500 tasks × 10 prompts × 2 Wh = 10,000 Wh.

That’s roughly 1/9 of the energy a person living in a moderately developed society uses in a single day (~90 kWh). In other words, it’s about as much power as a 60-watt light bulb running nonstop for a week.

This is, of course, a rough estimate. But even if a “moderately complex” app consisted of 5,000 moderately complex tasks (since “moderate” is in the eye of the beholder), we’re still talking about energy on the order of one human life-day.

Here’s the hypothesis: if AI can eventually write software entirely on its own, without human involvement, that could mean massive energy savings.

The real question is: what are these programs being written for in the first place?
