**Blake Lemoine as the new messiah.**

Can AI have a soul?

Let us attempt a thought experiment.

Suppose that humanity survives for X millions or even billions of years, and along with it endures the belief that the soul is an immanent part of the human being. This is by no means impossible.

Could it happen that, over such a span of time, human organisms begin to integrate with electronic components? Why not?
Even today, there are people who rely on implants to support their life and health.

So let us imagine that, over a vast stretch of time (consistent with our assumption of such an immense scale), this process evolves to the point where a new human emerges—an entity composed of far more “electronics” than biological matter.

And now the essential question:
**Would such a human still possess a soul?**
