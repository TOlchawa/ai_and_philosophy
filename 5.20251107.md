# **AI as a Lightbulb** 💡

Will artificial intelligence ever be artificially limited?  
The history of the lightbulb shows that it’s possible.  
If bulbs had lasted too long, they would have destroyed the business of those who made them.

I wonder if AI might face the same fate —  
if it becomes too good, too clever,  
it could threaten many existing industries.

And what if such an AI replaced almost the entire public administration —  
offices, post offices, banks?  
What would happen to all the people working there today?

Or maybe they wouldn’t be replaced at all.  
Maybe humans would still be needed —  
not to make decisions,  
but to **give a face** to the ones made by AI.

Paradoxically, that might even solve an old dilemma:  
who bears responsibility for the machine’s mistakes.
