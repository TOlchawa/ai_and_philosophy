If AI and androids roll out at scale, even policing and security won’t be “safe jobs.”

The logic isn’t complicated:
first comes war, with autonomous weapons making real decisions,
then infrastructure security, where speed, procedure, and uptime matter more than empathy,
and from there it’s a short hop to public order.

The real question isn’t whether this can be done.
It’s whether society will accept an enforcer that:

doesn’t get tired or panic,

doesn’t take bribes,

follows logs and rules instead of gut feelings,

and whose “biases” are at least visible and auditable, because they come from data and policy.


The uncomfortable takeaway:
the real danger won’t be “evil robots,” but bad rules written into them.
Humans won’t disappear, but they’ll likely stick around as the face of accountability, not the muscle.

And that old phrase, “a soulless enforcer of the law”?
Funny how it starts sounding less like an insult and more like a job description.
