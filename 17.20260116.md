**The New Roman Empire**

If AI wipes out a large share of white-collar jobs, that doesn’t mean the economy shuts down.

Factories don’t close just because the labor market shifts.

Capital hates idle capacity. It will keep demand alive.



The real question isn’t if, but how.



Guaranteed income?

Probably.

Not as compassion, but as plumbing.

You need consumers for the machine to keep running.



But money alone doesn’t cut it.

People need meaning, status, something to fight over.

And that’s where the second half comes in: the games.



The new games won’t be stadiums:

 - virtual worlds and games where status can still be earned,

 - politics as theater, not problem-solving,

 - endless culture wars and identity battles,

 - managed conflict instead of real fights over resources,

 - “us vs them” narratives, fine-tuned by algorithms.



Not to fix anything.

To keep people engaged.



This isn’t a conspiracy.

It’s a stable setup for a world where:

 - work stops being the main source of meaning,

 - attention and emotion become the core resources.



Rome had bread and circuses.

We’ll have transfers and a feed.



The real question isn’t whether this is good or bad.

It’s whether we can design something else before this becomes the default setting.



But this is mostly describing the status quo. So what does AI really change?
