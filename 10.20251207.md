** The problem of rich people **

Even the ultra‑wealthy who boast about self‑sufficiency rely on other people to feel superior. Research on social comparison shows that well‑being hinges on relative status. A high position is satisfying only when contrasted with someone worse off; seeing poorer people triggers a “pride effect,” giving them pleasure from dominance. Without that, robots cleaning and cooking do not produce jealousy or admiration.

Psychologists note that the rich often feel entitled to more—for instance, they are likelier to believe they deserve the first place in a lifeboat. When made to feel above others, they also make more unethical choices. In practice, watching the less fortunate feeds their ego, and empathy declines as wealth grows. Thus, a “herd” of poorer people isn’t an optional luxury but a psychological crutch. Machines can maintain comfort, but they can’t satisfy the need for comparison or provide the emotional thrill of superiority.
