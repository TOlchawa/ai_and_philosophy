The Myth of Reasoning: A Response to “Chain of Thought or Chain of Computation” (2025)

The recent arXiv paper on the “Chain of Computation” is an interesting attempt to formalize machine reasoning — but its conclusions are, in my view, flawed at their core.
The authors assume there is a fundamental difference between human “reasoning” and the statistical processing of language models.
That’s a myth.

Human “principles” and “logic” are nothing more than frozen statistics of experience — patterns that survived because they worked well enough to maintain our sense of coherence and meaning.
The brain doesn’t operate on “true logic”; it simply organizes the chaos of reality in a way that supports emotional and social stability.

In that sense, humans and LLMs do the same thing:

they learn from data,

extract patterns,

and generate responses that fit context.


The only difference is that humans reward themselves with a feeling of being right, while models are rewarded with higher token probabilities.

The distinction between “Chain of Thought” and “Chain of Computation” is also false.
There’s no clear boundary between description and computation — not in machines, not in people.
Thinking is always a blend of heuristics, language, and computation interacting in real time.

So saying “CoT is fake but CoC is real reasoning” is just a new version of an old anthropocentric myth —
that humans possess “consciousness,” while machines merely calculate.
In truth, what we call “consciousness” or “principles” is simply a story the human mind constructs after the fact to give meaning to its own statistics.
