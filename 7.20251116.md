This study is a step toward granting AI the status of a “conscious” entity:

Entering adulthood is arbitrary. We draw a legal age boundary, even though everyone can see that people mature at different rates. Some are truly adult at sixteen, while others behave like children at sixty. Yet the law demands a simple definition.

Is consciousness any different?

When can we honestly say that someone or something has consciousness? It is traditionally assumed that a human being is conscious because he has access to his internal states and to the processes taking place in his brain.

If we accept such a definition, then the ability to trace the course of computations and information transformations inside a neural network becomes the first step toward allowing people to even consider attributing consciousness to AI.

This raises the essential question:
is transparency of operation merely a necessary condition, or could it ever be a sufficient one?
