Watching videos of robot shows in China and popular entertainment gadgets, I initially had the impression that they were just cheap, plastic toys.
But that’s not always the case. There are safety norms and standards that such machines must meet (see Automate.org article).
These requirements exist because a robot designed for civilian use cannot be a “heavy machine for killing” if it is to be widely available and safe in everyday applications (e.g. ISO 25785-1:2025).
A similar situation can be seen with so-called “communion drones” – inexpensive consumer drones that, after simple modifications, have even found their place on the front lines of the war in Ukraine.

In Poland, the term “communion drone” (dron komunijny) is a colloquial expression referring to consumer drones often given as gifts to children on the occasion of their First Holy Communion. Some of these civilian devices have later been adapted for military use.
