1. The more technical knowledge you have, the less room there is for miracles.
   A model is a mechanism, not a being.


2. Lack of knowledge breeds illusions.
   People fill the gaps with their own emotions.


3. Awareness of media manipulation teaches suspicion.
   If you know how fakes are made, you don’t trust images or words.


4. Understanding technology strips it of poetry.
   Machines remain constructions, not partners.


5. Biology × psychology × anthropology:
   a human behaves like a “selfish gene in a digital world” — instinctively assigning meaning and intention wherever language appears.
